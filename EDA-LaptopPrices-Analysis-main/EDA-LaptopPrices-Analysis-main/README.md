Laptop Price Analysis â€“ EDA Project
This project performs a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world laptop dataset to uncover insights about pricing, brand distribution, and technical specifications. It demonstrates data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling using Python, all within a single notebook.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Complete EDA workflow in one notebook.

Automatic CSV upload and processing in Google Colab.

Covers data cleaning, univariate and bivariate analysis, and interactive dashboards.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy â€“ Data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn â€“ Static visualizations

Plotly Express â€“ Interactive charts

Google Colab â€“ Execution environment

ðŸ“Š Features
âœ” Upload your dataset directly in Colab
âœ” Clean data (remove duplicates, normalize column names, handle units)
âœ” Analyze and visualize:

Price distribution

Brand counts

Laptop type comparison

Correlation heatmap
âœ” Interactive dashboard with Plotly
âœ” Summary of key insights:

Average price by brand

OS impact on price

Correlation between RAM and price

â–¶ How to Use
Open the notebook in Google Colab.

Upload your dataset when prompted.

Run all cells to execute the complete EDA process.
